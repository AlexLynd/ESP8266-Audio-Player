# WiFu
WiFi controlled audio player / sound box based off the ESP8266, with a custom web interface self-hosted on the microcontroller.

## Why the hell is this project named WiFu?
My friend commissioned me to make a him a WiFi controllable voice box for his... (very cursed) cardboard waifu cutout.

## About
This is an open-source, Wi-Fi controlled audio player using the ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller.  It can play music and audio files through a Spotify-esque web interface I developed using Bootstrap and pure JS.  
The hardware design utilizes the DFPlayer sound module to load MP3 files from an SD card, which can be accessed and played seamlessly over WiFi.
